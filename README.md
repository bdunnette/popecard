# Vector Discordian Pope Cards

I like [Discordian Pope cards](http://discordia.wikia.com/wiki/Pope_cards).

I wanted to print a batch, but online I could only find low-quality `.jpg`
versions, so I took [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), used the low-quality as
a template grayed out in a background immutable layer, and redid them properly.

I release them under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) license: you can print
them, redistribute them, and *modify* them at will.

The fonts I used are:

* [Nimbus Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbus_Roman_No._9_L), as found
  in Debian
* [Nimbus Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbus_Sans), as found in Debian
* [Dearest](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Dearest) by West Wind Fonts
